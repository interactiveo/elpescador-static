"Bonefish, Tarpon and Snapper in the Heart of Maya Country",belize-in-a-breeze,5c684cb846b3673e71f2e38b,5c684cb846b3672d8cf2e3a0,Fri Oct 14 2016 22:39:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Jul 03 2024 21:06:11 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Jul 03 2024 21:52:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"<p>I grabbed my hat firmly as we blasted around the corner from Congrejo Flats into one of the east-west running fingers near Ambergris Caye locally known as the Seven Channels. Gilberto Acosta, at the wheel of his 23-foot panga fishing boat, opened the throttle on the 50-horsepower outboard.</p><p>My eyes feasted on the surrounding beauty, a translucent world in shades of turquoise. As we approached stretches with a sandy bottom, the color transformed into an incredibly vivid viridian hue. My hypnotic gaze ended only when a small spray of water dampened my face, the coolness awakening me to the reality of Belize, a country with waters still largely innocent and majestic. T his chunk of Central America coastline off northern Belize pulsated with marine life. Every few hundred yards I witnessed colossal schools of bonefish zipping over the flats. For every turn we made through the red mangroves, a cloud of mullet would thrash about until the clamor muddied the water. I watched a leopard ray soar into the air as if aiming for the clouds; it splashed back to its watery world with a resounding belly smack. Overhead, great squadrons of eagle-eyed birds glided until making dive-bombing runs, and seldom did one leave with empty talons.</p><p>This chunk of Central America coastline off northern Belize pulsated with marine life. Every few hundred yards I witnessed colossal schools of bonefish zipping over the flats. For every turn we made through the red mangroves, a cloud of mullet would thrash about until the clamor muddied the water. I watched a leopard ray soar into the air as if aiming for the clouds; it splashed back to its watery world with a resounding belly smack. Overhead, great squadrons of eagle-eyed birds glided until making divebombing runs, and seldom did one leave with empty talons.</p><p>Winds gusted 15 to 25 knots ¬ñ typical during the spring dry season off Ambergris Caye. The thermometer seemed to stay in the low 80s each day, and though the stiff breeze made it a challenge to cast at times, any cursing came with the appreciation that the wind also suppressed insect activity, which during summer months can be problematic near the subtropical shorelines.</p><p>Pescador Resort, put me in the capable hands of Gilberto Acosta and Cesar, his 19-year-old son. Gilberto, a veteran of 27 years guiding Ambergris Caye and surrounding areas, also teaches fly fishing; Cesar guides too. I asked if we could all fish together, and father and son smiled simultaneously, making it clear that they wouldn't argue a bit over that idea.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Sardines and Silver Kings</h2><p>Each morning we started with the ritual of catching live sardines for bait. Gilberto took this to a high art form with his weighted nylon cast net. He'd very smoothly launch the net, unfurling it with perfect pancakes many feet from the boat. One cast would deliver dozens of shimmering, shiny sardines, and the next might offer a half-dozen grunts or a small barracuda.</p><p>Once armed with a good supply of sardines, we'd patrol the flats on the south end of Ambergris Caye, moving slowly through the Seven Channels. Gilberto knew just how to use the wind to our advantage, particularly when on the hunt for rolling tarpon. Boca Chica Pass, a channel about 100 feet wide leading from the Caribbean Sea to the leeward side of the island, proved to be a reliable ambush point. As baits massed on the south shore, we'd see dozens of tarpon rolling, most in the 40- to 60- pound range.</p><p>On one such occasion, Cesar stood on the forward deck and back-casted a 12-weight fly outfit armed with a Black Death fly, a local favorite. On the fifth cast, he made two powerful strip strikes and shouted, ¬ìI'm hooked up, I'm hooked up.¬î With a teenage guide on one end of the line and a teenage tarpon on the other, the fish went ballistic.</p><p>Coming up half-bodied and mightily shaking its head, and then launching skyward repeatedly, the fly disengaged.</p><p>Cesar immediately returned the fly to the scene of the commotion, and amazingly another poon from the same school pounced on it. This skirmish as well ended in favor of the silver king, but so goes tarpon fishing. Even so, it left us all in a state of hyperventilation. Our hook-up ration soon improved, and we each released several fish before moving on to bonefish territory.</p><p>Gilberto said he'd put us on a spot renowned for reliable action on gray ghosts. I quickly saw just what he meant. Under a sunny sky and a falling tide, we went toe to fin with numerous bonefish on light tackle. Since these fish average only between two and five pounds, we scaled down our tackle. Gilberto went with a 5-weight fly rod with success on both shrimp and crab patterns. My spin rig of a Penn 5500 reel and medium-action Rhino rod did just fine, and a curly tail chartreuse jig tipped with a dollop of shrimp turned out to be quite popular. We released bonefish after bonefish, and you couldn't have wiped the silly grins off our faces if you tried. I must say that Gilberto and Cesar really impressed me. Gilberto, a powerfully built fellow, can launch the fly as far as the eye can see ¬ñ even into the wind. Cesar delivered casts with a smooth and silky delivery, and he knew just how to tease fish into striking. Both of these fellows rate at the top as guides and anglers.</p><h2>Beef on the Reef</h2><p>My burning desire to complete a flats grand slam by adding a permit to catches of bonefish and tarpon didn't pan out, although due to no one's fault. Permit tend to avoid the deeper portions of flats where they like to roam when it's windy, said Gilberto, shunning the lack of visibility for crustaceans and to prevent themselves from becoming prey to sharks. Instead, he suggested we move to the nearby reef for variety and rod-bending fun.</p><p>Belize is blessed with remarkable barrier reefs where fish thrive on the bountiful supply of baitfish and coral honeycombs. Gilberto ran to just east of Congrejo Caye, a few miles south of Ambergris Caye. We waited until the wind calmed down to about 10 knots and started trolling over the coral heads at about three knots. I used a nine-inch, redand- white Bomber Long A plug and Cesar offered up a bright-yellow, snub-nosed lure. At a depth of about 15 feet, the coral clusters appeared as dark blossoms and burnt fireplugs in the azure sea. It all looked mighty fishy, but no takers.</p><p>We switched gear and set anchor in about 12 feet of water at the west edge of the reef. With a bounty of sardines still alive and kicking in the bait well, we went with the real deal. I wielded a Penn 850SSM on a beefy rod with 30-pound monofilament line and a top shot of 80-pound fluorocarbon leader, tipped with a 3/0 circle hook sporting a lively sardine. A heavy egg sinker kept the bait hugging close to the bottom.</p><p>I struck pay-dirt almost instantly. Even with the drag cranked down pretty tight, it still sang as shrilly as an opera singer trying to break a glass. It felt like a jack of some kind, but I couldn't make out its shimmering glow for a good 15 minutes. As soon as the fish spotted the bottom of the panga, the 20-pound jack crevalle took off again, skillfully wrapping itself around our anchor chain in the process. Gilberto and I worked together to unravel the knot and keep the fish in play, and I soon brought the valiant fighter close enough so it could be leadered to the boat. We've all experienced these feisty fighters in various settings, and the Belize version certainly won't disappoint you.</p><p>The action at this primo spot continued non-stop for over two hours. I even managed a reef slam. I hauled in a nice lane snapper, several gray snapper and kept a few of the bull dogs of the reef ¬ñ mutton snapper ¬ñ from returning to the honeycomb of the reefs and certain break offs. Gilberto said he loves snapper grilled whole over a direct flame and jacks smoked slowly over cracked coconut husks and wood embers. The big jacks also gobbled flies with a frenzied furor, busting on any fast-stripped pattern and getting into the backing in a hurry. Our fly gear consisted of two 12-weight rigs: a Sage rod with a Billy Pate reel holding about 200 yards of Dacron backing, 105 feet of Rio intermediate weight fly line and 80-pound fluorocarbon leader, and an Ugly Stick rod with a matching Pflueger Trion reel spooled with a few hundred yards of gel coat backing, 105 feet of Orvis Wonderline and 100-pound fluorocarbon leader.</p><p>We kept the tackle on the heavier side for the snapper and jacks in order to get them to the boat faster. Doing so helped under-size fish regain the energy to escape the toothy reef critters always eager for a weakened target. Even so, some of the duels lasted up to 15 minutes due to the strength and stamina of these reef wrestlers. With plenty for dinner, we called it quits. And after so much pumping and winding all the tenacious jacks and sassy snapper this day, I didn't object at all as we ran back to El Pescador Lodge. The thought of a nice shoulder massage really filled my head.</p><p>And so it went each day we fished for bonefish, tarpon, jacks, and always willing snapper. I always feel my adrenaline starting to rise as I climb off the plane and plant my feet on Belizean soil. The variety of fishing is amazing due largely to the Belize Barrier Reef, an 185-mile reef line and three huge atolls that extend off the entire coast of the country. The longest such reef in the Western Hemisphere and second only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the Caribbean Sea flushes the coral structures and outcroppings with nourishing currents.</p><p>I've never visited without encountering plenty of tarpon and huge schools of bonefish, and most of the year you can expect permit as well. In the interior rivers, snook, tarpon and cubera snapper keep anglers busy, and deeper waters produce blue marlin, white marlin, wahoo, dorado and other deep-sea battlers. Giant black grouper weighing 60 pounds and more along the reef drop-offs can also put you and equipment to the test. While spring and summer months represent excellent fishing for most of these species, you'll find good action and fewer boats on the water during the fall and winter.</p><p>This represented the third trip for my wife Mary and me. We really like the melting pot of Belize because it blends ancient Mayan culture with British colonialism and a funky Caribbean charm. Toss in some of the best fishing in the world, and you know why our fourth visit won't be long in coming.</p><p><strong>Article with pictures provided courtesy of DestinationFish.travel</strong></p>",David Barton shares the experience chasing and landing lots of different fish from the flats to the reef while staying and fishing from our resort.,,,false,#607D8B,,"Experience the thrill of fishing in Belize with El Pescador.

Strip!"" ordered fishing guide Kachu Marin, crouched next to my friend Mike Traugott on the forward platform of the 23-foot panga. Mike began to strip in his fly line in short, deliberate tugs. Fifty feet from the skiff and three feet down in the greenish-blue water, the tiny fly inched forward erratically along the sandy bottom.</p><p>""Slow down!"" Marin barked.</p><p>Mike, a professor at the University of Michigan, slowed his pulls but also unintentionally swept his rod to the side.</p><p>""Don't pull your rod sideways!"" cried Marin, an exuberant teacher who delivered his fishing lessons in exclamation points. ""You go sideways, you're screwed!""</p><p>Somewhere in the turquoise water, a bonefish hit the tiny Mylar-and-fur fly. Mike pulled his rod sideways. As quickly as it hit, the fish was gone.</p><p>""No! Don't be going no sideways!"" Marin admonished. ""That's why you lost the fish!""</p><p>Mike cast again. ""A little short,"" Marin muttered under his breath. No matter. Strip! Strip! Slow down!</p><p>Another bonefish hit. Mike pulled the line straight back and deftly set the hook. A few minutes later, the spent bonefish was at the boat. Marin grabbed the leader and led the bone in increasingly tighter circles. Then, with a practiced move, he gracefully hoisted the silvery prize into the boat for a quick photo and live release.</p><p>""Good job, Mike! Good job, man!"" Marin beamed as he handed Mike the fat-shouldered, three-pound bonefish, his diploma from Bonefish U. Eight feet behind us, standing in waist-deep water, Speedy the human anchor smiled as he held tight to the thick plastic rope tied to the panga, holding us in place against the light breeze.</p><h2>Family Ties</h2><p>Kachu Marin is one of 20 guides who fish out of El Pescador Lodge on Belize's Ambergris Caye. The resort is one of a growing number of high-end fishing lodges that cater to a particularly exotic type of fly angler: the growing international band of obsessive-compulsives who chase bonefish, tarpon and permit in tropical and semitropical locales around the world. Among these elite lodges, El Pescador is one of the few where an angler has a reasonable shot at achieving the holy grail of shallow-water fly-fishing: catching all three species in a single day.</p><p>The 36-room lodge was built in 1974 on a site hacked out of a mangrove swamp on the southern end of Ambergris Caye, an extension of the Yucatan Peninsula that lies 12 miles off the northeast coast of Belize.</p><p>Today, El Pescador is owned by Ali Gentry, 35, who operates it with her mother, Chris Gentry Spiro, and stepfather, Stephen Spiro. Gentry's husband, Alonzo Flota, a native of San Pedro (the caye's only substantial town), is the resident dive master. (The local diving is world-famous; the second-longest coral reef in the world lies less than a half-mile offshore.)</p><p>El Pescador has a decidedly family-friendly feel. Absent is the coarseness of some fishing lodges. Everyone eats at a common table at set times. While we were there, one dinner featured a feast of lobster and stone crab; another, a deftly executed paella. Amenities abound: How many fishing lodges offer the services of an on-call masseuse who actually gives real massages? The lodge also features what may be the world's only combination fly-fishing-shop-jewelry-store-art-gallery. Forbes Traveler recently named El Pescador one of the world's top 10 luxury eco-resorts, though hard-core adventure-seekers may find it too domesticated.</p><p>The Gentrys have been quick to exploit a rapidly developing trend in tourism: family adventure travel, particularly during the holiday season. ""Instead of buying lots of gifts, more people now say, 'Let's go somewhere different where we can actually spend some time together,' "" Chris Spiro said.</p><p>Fishing manager Bob Stevenson oversees the 20 fishing guides who work out of El Pescador, 15 of whom specialize in fly-fishing. Mike and I fished with three guides during our four days at El Pescador. All were exceptional.</p><p>Bad weather or bad luck can result in a fishless day, even in Belize. We were skunked on our second day when we chose to chase the famously uncooperative resident tarpon in howling winds and occasional drenching rains; seeing the fish is essential to this kind of fishing.</p><p>But more often, the fault lies with the angler. ""Half the people who come to these places don't have the skills they need,"" Stevenson said. To remedy that, he conducts an evening casting clinic for anyone who wants a tutorial. (I did.)</p><p>Still, it's difficult not to catch something at El Pescador. Huge schools of smallish bonefish prowl the flats and eagerly charge a fly. ""If you want to learn, this is a great environment. . . . I'll put them on juvenile or adolescent bonefish all day long,"" Stevenson said. ""Will they catch a big bone? No. A permit? No. A tarpon? Probably not. They will catch fish.""</p><p>El Pescador has hosted its share of bold-faced names who like to fish. Marin, our bonefishing mentor, has guided Robert De Niro and his son. (""De Niro read a book all day in the boat. His son fished,"" Marin said.) Basketball coach Bobby Knight and actor Liam Neeson have fished out of El Pescador. Author John Grisham has made several trips and stays in one of the lodge's adjacent luxury villas.</p><p>Grisham's only complaint: The villa's bookshelves were filled with books, but none by John Grisham. ""He sent a boxload of his books down,"" Stevenson said.</p><h2>Fish or Fowl</h2><p>For those who want a break from the lodge, San Pedro is five minutes by water taxi. ""It's hardly Manhattan,"" Spiro laughed. ""But it offers great charm and fun little shops"" that specialize in local crafts (Belize is known for its wood carving) as well as jewelry and art.</p><p>A Sunday afternoon in San Pedro provided a welcome break for Mike and me from the beer-fueled bonhomie of El Pescador. The narrow streets were clogged with bicycles, golf carts and a few cars and small trucks. A word of caution to pedestrians: Driving in San Pedro is on the honor system. I saw no traffic lights, and the few stop signs seemed to be viewed by the locals as advisory, at best.</p><p>El Pescador offers day excursions at extra cost for non-anglers or those seeking a day off the water. Among the more popular is a trip to the ruins at Altun Ha, once a major Mayan trading center. A 20-minute trip by boat takes visitors across the shallow flats that separate Ambergris Caye from the mainland, and then it's an hour up the river to the ruins. (Keep an eye out for crocodiles, parrots and the Jesus bird, a small waterfowl that uses its webbed feet to scamper across the water.) There's a stop at a wood-crafts center and lunch at a rain forest resort. Another popular day trip for non-anglers is cave tubing, in which visitors ride on inner tubes down a jungle river through five large caverns. The lodge also arranges day trips to the Belize Zoo, world-famous for its collection of more than 125 animals native to Belize and for its role as an animal sanctuary.</p><p>""You can be as adventurous as you wish,"" Spiro said. ""You can do things every day that have nothing to do with angling. Then there is the obvious: Come to the Caribbean, sit in the sun, sip your rum drinks and read your book. That is a very popular activity.""</p><h2>Like Father, Like Son</h2><p>After three days of overcast skies that made spotting fish difficult, gusting winds that blew down our casts and occasional torrential rains, our luck finally changed on our fourth and final day.</p><p>For anglers, the weather in Belize is all about trade-offs: In the winter high season, it's cooler and dry -- but windy, bad for flycasting. In the low season, which corresponds to hurricane season, it's hot, humid and less windy -- but expect it to rain hard, though usually briefly, on most days. We were there in early October, start of the transition between the low and high seasons when anything or everything can happen. On this day, the sun rose in a nearly cloudless sky. The wind had slackened but didn't disappear, moderating the temperature.</p><p>Marin welcomed us aboard his panga, a shallow-draft wood-and-fiberglass skiff favored by guides and commercial fishermen in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. This was the best omen of all: His 66-year-old father, Carlos, the dean of guides at El Pescador, had guided us on our first day and had taken us to a sweet spot along a mangrove shore, where Mike caught an acrobatic 15-pound tarpon, the catch of the trip. Fishing mojo runs in families; perhaps his son would work similar magic on our last day.</p><p>Marin gunned the outboard and ran 20 miles north up the coast to a long, rocky point that jutted out to nearly intersect the reef. His knowing eyes scanned the water as we slowly cruised parallel to the beach, 100 feet offshore.</p><p>He finally found what he was looking for: a school of hundreds of bonefish feeding along the shore, their silver sides occasionally glinting in the sun as they turned to eat.</p><p>We fished this single school for more than five hours, catching fish and sharpening our technique. By the end of the day, Mike and I were casting farther, stripping in our flies more slowly and not pulling the rod sideways (!) when a fish struck. Together we caught more than 40 bonefish ranging in size from barely a pound to perhaps five pounds, typical for Belize bones.</p><p>Speedy, a friend of Marin's, was our human anchor. Literally. For five hours Speedy stood in three feet of water and held the plastic rope attached to the panga, keeping us within casting distance of a huge school of fish. Sometimes Marin would tell him to walk a few feet one way or the other. Several times Mike and I asked if he could come into the boat, but Marin assured us that Speedy was fine, and of course Speedy agreed.</p><p>One unexpected bonus, caught just before we quit for the day: a permit, considered the most difficult of the ""big three"" inshore game fish to catch on a fly. The iridescent, pearl-white fish was no bigger than a salad plate. But it was my first permit, caught on a fly that I had tied myself in my basement back home.</p><p>""Good job, man!"" Marin said, cradling the tiny fish in his hands. He extended his arms straight out toward the camera, a trick that makes fish appear larger in photos.</p><p>Size doesn't matter. I had finally graduated from Bonefish U.</p><p><em>Richard Morin, formerly director of polling for The Post, is a senior editor at the Pew Research Center in Washington.</em></p>",,,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/57fa7f0754bcd3af639ff409/582b996872617acd45557c42_bonefish-on.jpg,,,Fri Mar 28 2008 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"Discover El Pescador's family-friendly lodge on Ambergris Caye, Belize.

The Cessna Caravan gently dips its wing as if bowing to a beautiful woman. It’s a short flight from Belize City out to Ambergris Caye, but the view is a knockout. Of all the fishing destinations in the Northern Hemisphere, the country of Belize, formerly British Honduras, is the most like the Keys. This is particularly true of its outer islands, which are protected by the second-longest barrier reef in the world. There are mangrove-covered islands and the same greens and blues of the water. From the Yucatan Peninsula to the north, the “Mayan Riviera” is a seascape of flats. But here the barrier reef begins. While the other tourists on the plane point at the boats and islands, like all fishermen, I focus on the water, not the elements of scenery, scanning for the movement of shadows beneath the surface.</p><p id="""">The Mayan’s time here must have been spectacular. Builders of pyramids for astronomer’s study of the heavens, worship of time gods and spirits shaped like plumed serpents. They launched 4,000 trade canoes on an average day along this coast. The 25 miles of Ambergris Caye was a commerce center then. The Mayans had dug canals into it for shipping their boats into the markets. They held forth almost 3,000 years, rowing their craft to the cadence of their own songs of change. The British still garrisoned soldiers here when last I came to fish. The soldiers were young, brash and hard drinking. It was wise to steer around them in the pubs on Saturday night. Guatemala wanted to exercise its claim to the fledgling nation, until finally giving up after 30 years of stubbornness in 1992. The soldiers are gone hence. British Honduras is now Belize, a Mayan word for muddy water. This was probably derived from the Belize River. It’s a great place for snook fishing. There are over 200 islands off the coast, ranging from tiny mangrove postage stamps Gilligan couldn’t have hung on to, to the complete destination of Ambergris Caye in the North. From the air, it’s striking how much the environment resembles the Keys. Although the reef varies from 10 to 40 miles from the mainland, its line of breakers is only one half mile from the coast of Ambergris. This is a perfect corridor for water taxis—the best way to get around San Pedro town and the local establishments. It seems like the best places I’ve visited, I’ve gotten to by water.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/57fa7f0754bcd3af639ff409/604cbf446901262799cd3cae_GAFFBelizearticle_guide.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">There are over 400 square miles of flats here. Although the reef provides the opportunity to pursue many species of fish and the rapid drop off to 4,000 feet of blue Atlantic beckons the large game angler, it is the flats that are world class. Many come for the chance of a “Grand Slam”—catching a bonefish, permit and tarpon on a single trip. In its season, a snook can be added to this Triple Crown for a “Super Slam.”</p><p id="""">All are great game fish, but the flats fisherman knows well what waits to reward his venture. For all days on the ocean, there is always the sea and sky, but nowhere else in the saltwater environment does the angler become more at one with his natural setting. The flats are alive with life and death drama in the waving turtle grass and mangrove-lined channels. Each region of the flats is its own world. In the sunlight, it becomes a visual wonderland.</p><p id="""">Like the Florida Keys of a generation ago, you can stand on the prow of your boat and see miles of flats fished only by you. When you are there stalking, one becomes part of the day’s three-act theater in gin-clear water. The sky is bluer and the turquoise water suddenly changes to luminescent green above white sand bottom. It is like looking at a white light through an emerald. You couldn’t dream up anything more spectacular; it’s wilder than a 70s flashback. Only at some later point do you begin to recall that there was another world somewhere. There are some things present when a man is alone with nature that are not there at other times.</p><p id="""">Maybe I’m just a sucker for the classics. But just like the flats of Belize remind me of the old days in the Keys, the lodge we anchored up on was an angler’s daydream; an enduring masterpiece of colonial style, rich mahogany and wind-blown palms. This is El Pescador, Spanish for “The Fisherman.” It has added eight luxury villas to the original 13 rooms of the main lodge. I’ve fished over more than half of the globe. Accommodations have ranged from sleeping on the bare decks of boats on oceans so deep a stone would never find its bottom to thatched huts up rivers I couldn’t find on a map. They have also included five-star hotels; but there’s something about El Pescador. They seem to have gotten it just right, like a tuning fork that reverberates at a perfect pitch.</p><p id="""">Three generations of family continue to manage the lodge. The staff and guides mainly live there with them and are related themselves to the lodge through generations. The others come from a nearby village known as the “Valley of Peace.” They pride themselves on attention to intimate details. By the time you have lingered in this place for a few days you begin to feel like a part of the extended family yourself. Fishing expeditions of this caliber require properly equipping the angler. Some of the most important tackle intrinsic to maintaining the correct rhythm for fishing as well as possible is found at the bar. No lodge can be considered adequately outfitted without a good one. Your fingers can stay on the pulse of the situation at the bar, which has a good feel to it. This is especially important when you fish with the sort of hombres I travel with. They catch a lot of big fish. But these are much like UFO landings. Everyone gets to hear about them, but only one guy seems to have seen it.</p><p id="""">This is thirsty work like most fishing endeavors, and plenty of tipple assist in washing down what gets passed along as new legend. Even the beer down there has a picture of a Mayan pyramid on it—a symbol of a pathway to enlightenment. It suits the purpose well.
