Bonefish provided consistent action, while several tarpon were jumped and landed. Permit catches highlighted the week, and anglers also connected with snook, jacks, barracuda, and snapper.","<p id="""">Weather and Conditions: The past week brought classic early-season challenges with persistent north winds and scattered rain showers across Ambergris Caye. These conditions tested both anglers and guides, but also demonstrated why having experienced local guides is so crucial for success in saltwater fly fishing.</p><p id="""">Fishing Highlights: Bonefish continue to be our most reliable target, with schools holding in protected waters on the leeward side of the caye. Even first-time saltwater anglers found success, thanks to our guides' patient instruction on strip-setting and proper fly presentation. Most fish averaged 3-4 pounds, with a few larger specimens pushing 6 pounds.</p><p id="""">The resident tarpon population provided exciting moments, with several fish in the 60-80 pound range jumped and a few successfully brought to hand. These silver kings were found rolling in deeper channels during morning hours, particularly during tide changes.</p><p id="""">Permit, the most challenging of our grand slam species, made appearances throughout the week. Two fish were landed by experienced anglers using crab patterns, while several others were hooked but managed to shake free after powerful runs – a reminder of why permit are such prized catches.</p><p id="""">Bonus species included several nice snook holding around mangrove edges, along with jack crevalle providing explosive surface strikes. Our guides also led anglers to barracuda and snapper, offering excellent opportunities for those looking to bend their rods when conditions weren't ideal for flats fishing.</p><p id="""">Looking Ahead: Weather forecasts suggest improving conditions with winds expected to moderate. As we move into next week, look for prime opportunities across all species. Remember to pack both floating and intermediate lines, and don't hesitate to ask our guides about their preferred fly patterns for current conditions.</p><p id="""">Tip of the Week: For our visiting anglers, especially those new to saltwater: practice your casting before arrival, focusing on quick, accurate presentations in the 40-60 foot range. Our guides excel at teaching the necessary skills, but some preparation will help you make the most of your time on the water.</p>",,,,False,,,
