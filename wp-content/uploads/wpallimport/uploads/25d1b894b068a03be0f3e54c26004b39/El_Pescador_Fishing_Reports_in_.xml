The low tide has happened when the sun is high which makes it easier to see all those bonefish coming your way. First time bone fisherman and women have all been successful catching that coveted fish</p><p>‍</p>]]></bonefish>
		<permit><![CDATA[<p>The permit were receptive to the fly this week. Anglers landed as many as three in one day, which is a tall order when it comes to Permit fishing. Craig was one of those guys that enjoyed the tug of three fish in a single day with two making it to the boat. Thanks to everyone for being part of this week at the lodge. We look forward to the next time! The fish will be waiting.</p><p>‍</p>]]></permit>

A number of snook also were in this week's bag as were a large number of bonefish. Some anglers were blessed with up to 15 bones a day. One incredibly close and powerful thunderstorm drove a few fishermen off the flats temporarily, but guides have been able to dodge most rainstorms and make effective use of their time on the water in the changing light and wind conditions experienced this week.</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p>Last week, fishing improved with more favorable weather conditions. Bonefish were around in good numbers, and Tarpon were &nbsp;rolling in a number of locations. We enjoyed the company of a great Father and Daughter team this week. Gordon &amp; Meris McHaney both caught really good Tarpon of around 70 Lbs with Capt. Cesar. Meris also took a beautiful Permit of 20 Lbs.</p><p>Sadly, the lodge has now closed due to Covid-19. The silver lining is the fact that our fishery will be rested, and all the fishing pressure will be off. When we reopen, we expect an absolute ding dong kickoff !!</p>]]></postbody>

The fish were everywhere, and large numbers of Tarpon were seen rolling. They were reluctant to take flies as yesterday we had had a significant weather system pass by Belize, and with the sudden drop in Barometric pressure, the fish lost interest. Thankfully it is rising again, and we anticipate a bumper week ahead! We are so looking forward to seeing our extended El Pescador family back here in Belize ~ so do come see us soon!]]></postsummary>

Fishing was solid – some periods of excellent fishing and a few times when we were finding fish but couldn't get them to eat. Overall, we had a lot of chances at permit but didn't see as many Tarpon this week. There was good wade fishing for Bonefish and some Permit.</p>]]></postbody>

The first of the big tarpon have arrived, and we have landed 100+ pounders. We are seeing a lot of Permit and catching some of them! Some large Yellowtail Jacks were caught while they were blitzing, some of the most exciting fishing to be had. Once again, a great week in Belize.</p>]]></postbody>

We went from a couple of days of mostly spinning gear going out with guests to a bunch of handmade bamboo in the boats. Several guests caught firsts on the bamboo, and they still have more fishing to do. The spin fishing earlier in the week was excellent, and many anglers also succeeded in their first attempts at fly fishing. Jeremy, Tim, and Orland all had Grand Slams this week! Congratulations to them! We had several trip slams, also. An enjoyable week overall, with great fishing.</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">Hello, fellow anglers! This week at El Pescador Lodge and Villas in Belize was incredible. A few daring souls fled the sweltering Texas heat. They discovered their own paradise, graced by gentle trade winds and intermittent thunderstorms that added a dash of thrill and abundant sunlight that painted our waters with glimmers of gold.</p><p id="">The fishing scene was a wild ride, overflowing with excitement yet packed with its own set of surprises. It's been a bit of a roller coaster, as the elusive tarpon keeps us on our toes. One of our boats was even taken for a wild ride beyond the reef by a particularly feisty one!</p><p id="">Our Permit? As unpredictable as ever, keeping us guessing and offering some of our guests the opportunity to truly become the sleuths of the sea. Speaking of champions, a standing ovation for the dynamic duo, Kyle and Jackson, a father-son powerhouse that made their own history on the water. Both landed a Grand Slam in just one day. That is quite the feat!</p><p id="">As we relish in the thrills of this week, we also bid a heartfelt farewell to our beloved Guest Fishing Director, Will Stephens. Will may be stepping down from his role, but he will always be part of our El Pescador family. We eagerly anticipate his return.</p><p id="">Come on down and experience the thrill of the chase with El Pescador. You may come for the fish, but you'll stay for the family, adventure, and memories that will last a lifetime. You never know; you might be the next Kyle or Jackson! And remember to spread the love, share this post, and bring your fishing buddies along for an unforgettable adventure in Belize!</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">Some large tarpon were caught early in the week, and the sun has fired the permit fishing. We didn't focus on bonefish much this week, but it was excellent fishing when we did. The cloud cover had a lot of big bonefish up tailing in the lagoons, and fishing them from a canoe was super. Some snook were caught this week in the lagoons, the flats, and from nearby docks. Gary caught a tarpon well over a hundred pounds – his biggest tarpon to date.</p><p id="">The real story this week was slams. Phil R had a spin slam, way to go!! John F had a Grand Slam. Then John got another Grand Slam! That is a great trip, John! Gary and Brent both got Grand Slams on the same day! With extra permit for good measure.

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">A great week with some of our favorite regular customers at the lodge with us!</p><p id="">Belize has settled into a regular cycle of good weather and the fishing was excellent. Our overcast days produced good early morning tarpon fishing, including the big migratory fish. The early morning calm winds allowed us to fish some mainland spots for tarpon, also, even getting up some of the river systems. A couple of snook were caught over there also, and many more spotted and stalked. Our sunny days were all about the permit. Dan and Sandy both caught their first permit. Dan caught a big one while his guide was cooking a shore lunch. Dan was the first to say that it was only because of everything Michael taught him, though.</p><p id="">Paul has fished with us and Captain Junior many times, but Junior showed him a lot of new water this week as they explored several new areas. Paul wore himself out early catching some big tarpon, but rested one day while fishng a few hours with Mariano in the lagoons. He has a few days left to find some more permit!</p><p id="">Our good friend Bob finally got all of his Grand Slam fish caught in one day and he will be enshrined in our Grand Slam Wall of Fame! He has been very successful while fishing with us but this one accomplishment has been very elusive for him. Congratulations Bob!</p><p id="">Forrest has returned to host an Orvis trip and we look forward to the fish tales from the group in our next fishing report. Good luck to everyone out there chasing the dream!</p><p>‍</p>]]></postbody>

		<postsummary><![CDATA[This past week at Ambergris Caye was buzzing with excitement as Mossy Creek Flyfishing enthusiasts joined us, with Nick finally breaking his tarpon curse! Young anglers marked their debut, showcasing a growing passion for the sport, especially for tarpon and a diverse range of fish species. With serene mornings and shining sun, we ventured to the mainland and pursued permit, encountering and landing several impressive tarpon. Keep an eye out for the increasing schools of Jack Crevalle! As we gear up for another week, our boats are set with devoted permit fishermen. Here's to more thrilling catches!  ]]></postsummary>
		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">A great group came down with Mossy Creek Flyfishing in Harrisburg, VA. Nick, we are glad you broke your tarpon curse and we look forward to next year!</p><p id="">We also had some father/son pairings come down to try some Grand Slam fishing. The younger fishermen had many "firsts" and were excited about their next trip. We especially enjoy seeing the more youthful generation catch the addiction! I know one young man who has become a little obsessed with Tarpon and another who can recite the long list of fish species he landed on this trip.<br>Overall, it was a terrific week of fishing. Calmer mornings let us take a few runs to the mainland for a change of pace. We got after the permit when the sun was shining, and many good Tarpon were encountered, and some landed! We are seeing more schools of large Jack Crevalle these days, too.</p><p id="">We have a few boats going out this coming week, and they are all diehard permit fishermen. We are wishing them all good luck!</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">It was an unofficial Father/Son week at El Pescador Lodge! By coincidence, most of our groups were father and son groups of all ages. We had a lot of first timers with a fly rod this week and a lot of non-fly fishing adventures, also. Reef fishing, shore lunches, Mayan ruin tours, town excursions, Secret beach trips, spa and massage time, and plenty of pool and sun time were enjoyed by our guests. Several trip slams got done this week but couldn't quite get it done in one day. Some especially nice snook were hooked and a few were boated. Lots of other fish were caught, including a lot of Jack Crevalles, pufferfish, and snapper. Some of our guests brought up Queen Snappers from 800 feet down! <br>We changed up our regular fishing routines this week and it was a fun week for all.</p><p>‍</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">Happy Thanksgiving from everyone at El Pescador! This past week, as we celebrated with delectable feasts and the company of wonderful friends, our fishing adventures were equally thrilling.</p><p id="">While the number of Permit caught was slightly lower than in some previous weeks, these elusive fish were still a prominent feature around our boats. The Tarpon, particularly the spirited juveniles, provided an exciting challenge in the lagoons and rivers with their acrobatic jumps and the difficulty they present in landing. Additionally, anglers encountered larger resident Tarpon in the flats, adding to the week's excitement.</p><p id="">The highlight of the week, however, was the remarkable Snook fishing. We experienced some of the best Snook catches to date, marking personal bests for several of our clients. As for the Bonefish enthusiasts, they enjoyed a fantastic week as well. The Bonefish were particularly cooperative, especially in the sun-kissed sand flats, eagerly biting and providing great sport.</p><p id="">As we reflect on a week filled with joy, friendship, and exceptional fishing, we look forward to more such wonderful experiences here at El Pescador.</p>]]></postbody>

Anglers enjoyed the thrill of Permit fishing under the bright Belizean sun and a lively east wind. Though always a challenge, our guests rose to the occasion, landing some impressive Bonefish, particularly on the sand flats. The Tarpon were a bit more elusive in the sunny, crystal waters, but their pursuit remained an exhilarating part of the experience. Our Snook catches continue to delight, although they didn't quite match the extraordinary success of recent weeks.</p><p id="">In the spirit of the season, San Pedro sparkled under the glow of its official Christmas Tree lighting this past Saturday night.

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">The weather conditions could have been better this past week. We had a few days with strong winds and a few other days with perfect weather. You can never tell what kind of weather we're going to have here on the island. But that doesn't stop us from catching those fish out in the water. At the end of the week, we caught a good number of Bonefish, Permit, Tarpon, and other species such as Barracuda, Jacks, and Snappers.</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">The past two weeks have been challenging for us here at El Pescador Lodge. Last week, Hurricane Beryl was heading towards the island, which limited our ability to get as many boats out as we would have liked. The conditions were tough throughout the week. This week has been slow as well, with only two anglers fishing every other day. Despite these challenges, they still managed to hook and land some fish. They caught plenty of Bonefish, jumped a few Tarpon, and landed a couple of them. They also succeeded in landing a couple of Permit.</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">Weather and Conditions: The past week brought classic early-season challenges with persistent north winds and scattered rain showers across Ambergris Caye. These conditions tested both anglers and guides, but also demonstrated why having experienced local guides is so crucial for success in saltwater fly fishing.</p><p id="">Fishing Highlights: Bonefish continue to be our most reliable target, with schools holding in protected waters on the leeward side of the caye. Even first-time saltwater anglers found success, thanks to our guides' patient instruction on strip-setting and proper fly presentation. Most fish averaged 3-4 pounds, with a few larger specimens pushing 6 pounds.</p><p id="">The resident tarpon population provided exciting moments, with several fish in the 60-80 pound range jumped and a few successfully brought to hand. These silver kings were found rolling in deeper channels during morning hours, particularly during tide changes.</p><p id="">Permit, the most challenging of our grand slam species, made appearances throughout the week. Two fish were landed by experienced anglers using crab patterns, while several others were hooked but managed to shake free after powerful runs – a reminder of why permit are such prized catches.</p><p id="">Bonus species included several nice snook holding around mangrove edges, along with jack crevalle providing explosive surface strikes. Our guides also led anglers to barracuda and snapper, offering excellent opportunities for those looking to bend their rods when conditions weren't ideal for flats fishing.</p><p id="">Looking Ahead: Weather forecasts suggest improving conditions with winds expected to moderate. As we move into next week, look for prime opportunities across all species. Remember to pack both floating and intermediate lines, and don't hesitate to ask our guides about their preferred fly patterns for current conditions.</p><p id="">Tip of the Week: For our visiting anglers, especially those new to saltwater: practice your casting before arrival, focusing on quick, accurate presentations in the 40-60 foot range. Our guides excel at teaching the necessary skills, but some preparation will help you make the most of your time on the water.</p>]]></postbody>

The guides are doing a great job keeping guests into fish in the protective coves mainly on the west side of the island. Bonefishing has been the stock and trade and guests are reporting good numbers. Several guests coming back each day with double digit numbers of bones and several trophy fish.

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p>Last week was tougher than normal here at El Pescador as the weather and wind were not friendly. &nbsp;The guides are doing a great job keeping guests into fish in the protective coves mainly on the west side of the island. &nbsp;Bonefishing has been the stock and trade and guests are reporting good numbers. Several guests coming back each day with double digit numbers of bones and several trophy fish. &nbsp;Permit fishing has been tough with the wind. &nbsp;Tarpon are being caught tight to the mangroves along with snook. &nbsp; Good weather on the horizon and we are all excited to put these last few cold fronts behind us.</p>]]></postbody>

		<postbody><![CDATA[<p id="">What a great week on Ambergris Caye! We had our first cold front of the fall, and it was glorious. Winds out of the north most of the week made it feel much cooler on the island, even though the temperatures didn't change too much. It allowed us to get over to the mainland more often, and we caught some nice snook. </p><p id="">Keith brought a crew down from Houston for a quick trip, and we had a great time with many folks experiencing Belize and El Pescador for the first time. They had a lot of fun learning to saltwater flyfish and caught many fish in just two days of fishing. We look forward to seeing them all again soon. </p><p id="">Some long-term friends and clients from Virginia, Dennis Stanley, and his family and friends, came in to enjoy the great weather, also.</p><p id="">The eclipse was a mixed bag for us and came through while most of our guests were out fishing. The staff had fun finding different ways to look at it. Some of them turned out great, especially how the light filtered through the palm fronds in moon-like shapes. Some guests got excellent video through holes in the clouds that worked perfectly.</p><p id="">We had quite a bit of sun this week, which led to good permit fishing in a wide variety of sizes. The tarpon weren't biting great, but we saw many of them, hooked a good number, and landed enough! Overall, I can't complain!</p><p id="">‍</p>]]></postbody>
